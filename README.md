# Welcome to Foundations of Computing for Biologists

pounds for headings (1) and subheadings (2)

file format use most often in class = plain text file
	- word saves metadata, formatting etc --> hard to use for coding
	- plain text files are simpler (ex: csv)
sublime lets you use plain text files-download!
	-will colorcode markdown files for you
.rtf not same as plain text
*always double check that it's plain text file before saving/using
Using Terminal a lot this semester
	-download gitbash

~ = home directory

on terminal write ctrl +c to make new line 
cys-help@loni.org helps with login stuff

clear = clear whole screen 
logout = log out of terminal

- Survey

- Overview of Operating Systems
  aka OS
  - Windows = propriotory
    	-bc no unix have to use GitBASH
  - Mac = propriotory
   	-based on unix (older operating syst that its based on)
  - Linux = crowd sourced (anyone can modify source code, unlike other 2)
   	-"flavors" = different versions (ex: RedHat)
    -based on unix

	differences dont matter thru the mike terminal website

- Some fundamentals
  - Memory (RAM)
    - amount space computer has to for you to work on what youre doing now (short term; "desk")
    - fluid, changes a lot depending on what working on 
  - File storage (hard drives)
    	-all older files
    	-more storage, but takes longer to find
    	-different types (solid state=more expensive, less moving pieces)
  - CPU
    -thing thats doing the work on the computer
    - = central processing unit
    - fast
    - indiv CPUs hitting plateau with speed => computers now have multiple CPUs 
  - GPU
    - = graphics processing unit
    - started with graphics, now used for AI
    - 1000s tiny processors, allows for a lot of computing in a short amnt of time
    - parallel computing-lots of computing happening at once [vs serial computing-one after the other]

- Unix Filesystem
	- [Filesystem overview](https://github.com/FoundCompBio-Spr26/Intro_Week1/blob/main/Filesystems.md)
 	- The Unix root (/)
   		- The very base of the filesystem
       	- single folder that holds everything (bottom container)
  path=route to files
	- Absolute paths
		- All absolute paths begin at the root- start with /
    	- full address ex. 123 main st
	- Relative paths
		- Don't start with /
		- Working directories
		- Shortcuts for current and parent directories
    	- relative to where are rn, this is path you take, only works if starting in that spot
       	-shorter, but depends on starting in particular location
	- Hidden files and folders
		- Names begin with `.`
		- Usually used for configuration files
